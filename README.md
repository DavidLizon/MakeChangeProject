# Make Change Project

## Description
This is a project utilizing if-else, do-while, switch statements, and several methods to ask the user to enter the cost of the item they wish to purchase and how much they wish to pay for that item. The program continues to ask the user how much they're going to pay if the amount offered is less than the price. If they paid the exact amount the program tells them so and if they overpaid it calculates and returns the change with the highest denominations possible. The program then repeats if the user doesn't enter a Y or a N. To run the program download the java file, compile the file if needed, and run in an appropriate program. 

## What I learned
This first project has taught me many things and these are a few of the take-aways. First, was to read through my conditions step by step if I'm not getting the results I expected. I also learned that you not only need to read through step by step but to pay attention to what is written and not what you expect to be written. The program also taught me that there are some quirks with using the MOD operator and that it's sometimes best to round to a desired decimal value to make computations more accurate. I learned how important methods are to minimizing errors and making it easy to fix issues in the code. Instead of having to repeat the change in multiple areas you just have to change it in one area which reduces the chances for an error. The last thing I learned is to double check your code even if you tested it and thought it was error free; Give it another once over and test it with some other conditions to verify you have a working product that does what you want.
